# AssistPro Web - Quick Assessment Summary

**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Status:** ⚠️ **NOT READY FOR PUBLICATION**

---

## The Answer to "Can it be published?"

### 🔴 NO - Not Yet

The app **technically works** (builds, runs, no security issues), but has **placeholder content** that must be replaced before going live.

---

## What's the Problem?

### Critical Issues:

1. **Fake Social Media Links** 🔗
   - Currently links to @assistpro accounts that may not exist
   - Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, LinkedIn all need real URLs

2. **Missing Download Links** 📱
   - App Store and Google Play buttons go nowhere
   - Wait until apps are ready, or remove these buttons

3. **No Legal Pages** ⚖️
   - Footer links to Privacy, Terms, Provider Standards
   - These pages don't exist yet
   - **CRITICAL** for a professional services platform

4. **No Branding Assets** 🎨
   - No favicon (tab icon)
   - No app icons for mobile
